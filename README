Copy source code from a list website to <name>.html file
 - pretty it up a little so there are no header or tail lines to worry about
 - Run: %s/&#8217;/'/g in vim to put in apostrophies if needed

Customize an extract<name>.awk file to pull out title and author

run$ awk -f extract<name>.awk -f functionLibrary.awk <name>.html

Will result in <name>.table file
From now on any edits that need made should be done to the .table file

Now run ./tabulateBooks.sh to generate the tabulatedData.csv file 
	  (edit the tabulateBooks.sh file to include the desired .table files)

**Needs updating**
Run python findDuplicates.py tabulatedBooks.csv
    If duplicates are found, edit the .table files such that the names agree

Rerun tabulateBooks.sh

Run ./scrapeDates tabulatedBooks.dat
	- This tries to find published dates using google and wolframalpha 
	  and overwrites tabulatedBooks_withDates.csv file (first copying current
    file to tabulatedBooks_withData.csv.backup)
